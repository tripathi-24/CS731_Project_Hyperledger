# CS731_Project_Hyperledger
This project is based on online booking system for Air, Rail and Road travel using Blockchain technology.
The project will be implemented in following manner:

This project leverages IBM Hyperledger Fabric to implement a decentralized and
immutable ledger for managing seat distribution across various modes of transportation,
including buses, trains, and airplanes. The platform enables customers to book, modify, and
cancel tickets while ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized access. Service
providers can list travel options, manage ticket prices dynamically, and verify passenger
details securely.
The system ensures transparency through blockchain verification, enabling real-time
tracking of bookings while preventing overbooking and double-booking scenarios.
Additionally, privacy is maintained by restricting access to sensitive information, ensuring
that customers and service providers interact securely.
This report outlines the functional and technical aspects of the system, including the
blockchain implementation, backend API development, and integration with a dummy
payment system. The aim is to create a scalable and reliable ticket management solution
that revolutionizes the way travel bookings are handled.
